# Iconopedia-gtk
This is a guide for python and GTK devs for icons and stock items. I made that application as an exercise, 
but it can really be usefull for a PyGObject developper. Works fine. But as i am begginner, 
my lame code makes pep8 crying  ;Â°D. I swear i'll do better a next time.

# todo :
I'd still like to continue this project, i have to :

- set a "watch" mouse cursor while some heavy gtk elements are being building (huge listboxes !)
- i'm still looking for a way to serialize a pyGObject object (pickle doesn't work for that) to optimize the reactivity of the application. It doesn't look possible...

Anyway, thanks for reading, feel free to leave a word if you have an idea for that 2 todo tasks, or not.
