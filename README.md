# Iconopedia-gtk
This is a guide for python and GTK devs for icons and stock items. I made that application as an exercise, 
but it can really be usefull for a PyGObject developper. Works fine. But as i am begginner, 
my lame code makes pep8 crying  ;°D. I swear i'll do better a next time.

# todo :
I'd still like to continue this project, i have to :

- set a "watch" mouse cursor while some heavy gtk elements are being building (huge listboxes !)
- i'm still looking for a way to save (pickle doesn't work for that) the already built huge listboxes in some files, 
to optimize the reactivity of the application.

Anyway, thanks for reading, feel free to leave a word if you have an idea for that 2 todo tasks, or not.
